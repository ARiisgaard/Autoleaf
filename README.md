# Autoleaf
A program for making Overleaf easier to use by adding hotkeys for the most common functions. 

Autoleaf.exe is the stand-alone edition of the program. If you want to make some changes to the code you can make your own edition using the souce code in Autoleaf.ahk. That file can't run without installing the program AutoHotKey. 

Be aware that the program is build around a preamble provided by IDA. For making the figure-commands functional the graphicx package is needed. For the sourcing-command the included attached .bst file must be used
